			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a young professional with an interest in the game development industry. My significant experience in
				this
				field was my participation in the Game Jam competition, where I, together with a team of three classmates,
				developed a game that was awarded the title 'The game that the judges will play after the Game Jam'. This
				project allowed me to expand my knowledge of game development, as well as develop teamwork, creative
				thinking,
				and problem-solving skills. I am passionate about the gaming industry and want to continue developing in
				this field.

					<h3>Course work</h3>
					<p>2D платформер “RABBIT” (С#, Unity)
						2D platformer "RABBIT" (C#, Unity) 2D platformer "RABBIT" is my project developed using C# and
						Unity. In this project, all scripts are written in C#, and 2D animation is used, which is called
						inside the code, and the main classes of the Unity API. The main functionality of the game is to
						move the main character, read input keys, change the direction of his movement, and detect collisions
						with objects on the stage. In addition, the game has implemented the processing of button pressing
						events,
						which allows you to change the character's animation depending on his movements. The game also has
						enemies
						that the hero can encounter. The function of finding and destroying enemies is implemented, which
						allows
						the player to complete the level. It is also possible to obtain bonuses that affect the hero and
						process
						their effects. In addition, a life system has been implemented, which provides for the loss of the
						hero's
						life in case of collision with enemies or loss of life, as well as the ability to transfer data
						between game
						levels. All these features were written using C# and the Unity API, which allows us to create a decent
						and
						interesting 2D platformer "RABBIT".</p>

					<h3>The game was developed by the team during the Game Jam 2023 competition</h3>
					<p>2D root crops simulator "Under Tree" (C#, Unity) This project was developed by a
						team of four peopleDuring the development of this project, I created a graphical interface of root
						crops,
						including the game menu and controls. The functionality of the bugs was also my task. I implemented
						their
						movement, and customized the interaction between the beetles and the root crops, adding the ability
						for the
						beetles to eat or damage them. In addition to development, I also performed test tasks. I tested
						different
						aspects of the game to make sure it worked properly. I created bug reports that we fixed later. In
						general,
						my work in the Under Tree project was focused on developing root crops, animating beetles, testing,
						and creating
						bug reports. This project was an interesting and challenging experience for me, some of the ideas and
						functionality
						I developed were new to me, which added a lot of challenges and opportunities to develop my skills.

					<h3>Diploma project</h3>
					<p>3D Survival Game «Kill Or Die» (С#, Unity)
						3D Survival Game "Kill Or Die" (C#, Unity) During the development of the "Kill Or Die" project, I was
						responsible
						for creating the main music of the game, which I composed myself. I also developed several 3D models
						and textures
						for the game. In the project, I used various programming techniques such as mesh-agent for character
						movement in the
						game, coroutines for asynchronous execution of various tasks, raycast for detecting obstacles and
						interacting with them,
						Animation Events for synchronizing animations with game events. I also followed the principles of
						object-oriented
						programming in the code and used various design patterns to improve the structure and expand the
						game's capabilities.
						The whole project took about 3 months of development, and it became my graduation project. It was a
						challenging, but at
						the same time interesting and stimulating experience that allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills
						in the field
						of game development.</p>

					<h3>Test application №1</h3>
					<p>2D game "Hill Climb Racing" (C#, Unity)
						I developed this project for a test assignment and spent about 6 hours on it.
						With the help of basic knowledge, I realized the physical behavior of the car, its movement and
						interaction with the road.
						To provide realistic car control, I used the physics engine built into Unity
						and created a keyboard-based control system. In addition, to add entertainment to the players, I
						created
						an achievement system. Overall, developing Hill Climb Racing was an interesting challenge and
						increased my development and programming skills in the Unity environment.</p>

					<h3>Test application №2</h3>
					<p>Application for file compression (C#)
						I developed this project to compress text, media and audio files.
						In the process of developing the application, I used the C# programming language and the Visual Studio
						environment.
						The project included creating a user interface where the user could select files to be compressed.
						I also added buttons to save the compressed files.
						To compress text files, I used the Huffman algorithm. This algorithm is based on the construction of
						the optimal prefix code for text characters. After compression, smaller file sizes were obtained,
						which allowed me to save disk space.
						To compress audio and media files, I used NuGet packages such as "NAudio" and system
						system libraries.
						These packages provided functionality for processing audio and video data, including compression.</p>
